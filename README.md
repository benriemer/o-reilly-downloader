## Username/password login <a name = "username_password"></a>

First, find a book in O'Reilly Learning. Here I picked the famous `Art of Computer Programming` by Knuth,
you can find it at [https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635754/).

Copy the ID of the book (in this case `9780321635754`)

And then run following command in the directory where you download the script

```sh
bash oreilly-downloader.sh -b `9780321635754` -t art-of-computer -f pdf || epub || both 
```
*only one argument is required to set data type*
<br>

| syntax  | argument  | explanation                                                         | example                       
| ----------------|------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `book id`   | `-b`| the ID of the book                                                  | `9780321635754`               |
| `title`    | `-t` | the title of the book - you can use every title you want. Please make sure to not use spaces | `art-of-computer`   |
| `print-as`    | `-f` | what format you want the book: epub -> pdf ->¬†both | `art-of-computer`   |
<br><br>
## Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the script ready.

Be sure you have Docker installed and running

Be sure you have calibre installed and the cli
```sh
# test calibre cli with
ebook-convert --version
# shell output
ebook-convert (calibre 5.39.1)
#Created by: Kovid Goyal <kovid@kovidgoyal.net>
```

Make sure you set-up your account at o'reilly. Then open `user.conf.sample` file with text editor (vim, nano, code) and insert your username and password or:

```sh
echo "your-username" >> user.conf.sample
echo "your-password" >> user.conf.sample
```
Then move the file to `data` directory. Please vaidate you have a directory called data or create a new one

```sh
mkdir -p data
mv user.conf.sample data/user.conf
```


### Downloading every book by executing following command: ###
